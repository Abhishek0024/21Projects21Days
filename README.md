# 21 Projects in 21 Days ðŸš€
### Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Generative AI

Welcome to my journey through **21 AI Projects in 21 Days**, inspired by GeeksforGeeksâ€™ hands-on program! This repository is a collection of daily projects covering everything from foundational Machine Learning to cutting-edge Generative AI, including chatbots, image recognition, text-to-SQL, AI agents, and more.

Each project is **deployable**, beginner-friendly, and designed to build a **portfolio that demonstrates real-world AI development skills**.
